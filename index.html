        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I'm Jana Pretorius, a 32-year-old happily married woman and expecting our first baby. I was born and
            raised in Durbanville, our beautiful Cape Town. My journey has been a
            dynamic one, filled with transformation and passion.
            After completing my education in 2009, I earned my degree in Dental
            Technology at Cape Peninsula University of Technology
            (CPUT) in 2015. After a few years I decided to take a leap and
            switch careers, embracing change as a path to personal growth.</p>
            <p>I have 5 years experience in the administration, reception
            and personal assistance field. I have good communication,
            organization and delegation skills and enjoy working with people
            and adapt quickly to a new environment. I love making lists and
            prioritize effectively. I am also good with team building and always strive to give my best performance. I am a
            people pleaser type of person.<br /></p>
            <p>Now, I am taking another leap of faith to persue a completely different path to test my creative and logical skills.
            I am currently studying Web Development to become proficient in Frontend deparment. <br /> I am very excited and nervous for this journey, 
            but I know I am only now, really following my dream.</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to review my resume.</p>
